# StreamSizeCalculator

This is a tool to calculate network requirements for streaming 2110-20 video.
After first tests, this tool seem to have an accuracy of 99,8 percent.

## Usage
To use this tool, simply download the zip or clone this directory and open the index.html with your browser. I tested this tool only on Firefox, but it should work on any browser.

## Third party
The tool uses local copies of [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for convenient DOM mainpulation and [Spectre.css](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/index.html) for the look.
